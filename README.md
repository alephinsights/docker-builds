# docker-builds

### Contact me - peter@alephinsights.com

A collection of docker builds I maintain for various projects.

**Not recommended for production environments.**  Presented as they are with no warranty or guarrantee. Use at your own risk. But if you get in touch with a problem, I'll see what I can do to help

Feel free to clone and hack about as you see fit.

## Inspiration and Acknolwedgements

My main inspiration for keeping these was a pal - he kindly suggested I stop trying to ballence various environment requirements on my native system!

Also [senbon](https://github.com/senbon/dockerfiles) who in turn was inspired by [Kaixhin](https://github.com/Kaixhin/dockerfiles) - some really good resources there.
